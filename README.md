Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychother-
apy that helps patients learn skills to regulate emotions as a central
strategy to improve life functioning. However, DBT skills require
a long-term and consistent commitment, typically to group therapy
over the course of months. Patients who might benefit may find this
approach undesirable; it can be challenging to transfer learning from
therapy sessions to daily life, and there is no way to personalize skills
learning based on individualized needs. In this paper we propose the
use of Augmented Reality (AR) and digital biomarkers to enhance
DBT skill exercises to be more immersive and personalized by using
physiological data as real-time feedback. To explore the feasibility
of AR-based DBT skill implementation, we developed AR-based
DBT skill exercises that manipulate the userâ€™s thermal perception
by visualizing different thermal information in holograms. We con-
ducted a user study to evaluate the impact of AR in changing the
thermal perception and emotional states of the user with an analysis
of physiological data collected from wearable devices.
